# Online Fingerprint Voting

Description - An application that a person can login to to cast their vote in any election. While the application will start with a user ID and password, the user will be able to submit their fingerprint as their authentication when voting. The application will only allow a user to vote once in any election and only vote for one candidate in that particular election. The candidates will be presented in the application by photo with a general description and links to their biography and where they stand on pertinate issues. This application will create an easier way to vote in elections. A touch free enviornment in the COVID era. With the concern of voter fraud the fingerprint option will eventually become a requirement.

Installation - Because the application will have to serve all types pf people it needs to be simple and succint. There will be a webpage and a mobile application will be added once the webpage is operational. Admin will be responsible for adding candidates and putting in the date when the election will end. 


Usage - Two factor authentication will be required. Multiple documents will have to be submitted to complete a user's registration. The user can submit their fingerprint after their registration is complete. A service can be outsourced for this. The documents will have to be checked against state and federal agencies. Examples are DMV and the IRS. Each election will have the ability to vote on candidates added on the date voting is set to begin. Before that candidates will have their photos and information as soon as they are announced as candidates. Once an election is complete the candidates information will be deleted automatically. Election results will be posted immediately after the end date.
